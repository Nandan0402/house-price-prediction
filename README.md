# 🏠 House Price Prediction 📈

---

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **Machine Learning workflow** to predict house prices using the **California Housing dataset**.  
A **Linear Regression model** is used to estimate median house values based on socio-economic and location features.

This project is part of my **AI / Machine Learning learning journey**.
